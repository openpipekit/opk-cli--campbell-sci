To get R jsonlite package to install I had to do https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=111375 and uncomment CONF_SWAPFILE=/var/swap

Then I ran
sudo Rscript -e "install.packages('jsonlite', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')"

This could probably be run from the install script though
